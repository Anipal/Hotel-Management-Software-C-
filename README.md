# Hotel-Management-Software-C-
This project is a simple hotel management software created using C++ and is a good example of the various OOPS concepts as well as C++ basics such as classes, objects, constructors, constructor overloading, inline functions, operator overloading, global variable, static data member, friend functions, arrays, if-else statements, switch case, conditional loops, passing objects as pointers etc. The main aim of the software is to ease hotel management by providing a platform for booking and vacating rooms, managing customer records and calculating amount to be paid by customers. The software is very user friendly and can be scaled further to include more features without disturbing the current architecture due to the flexibility provided by OOPS
